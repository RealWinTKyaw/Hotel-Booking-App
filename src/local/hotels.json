The style of this hotel is just unique. The restoration works took a long time due to the fact that this is a registered property and the aim was to bring back one of the most beautiful and interested palaces in Europe in 1600. This is a gorgeous palace going back to the splendours of the 17th century, when Venice was at the peak of its wealth and power. The palace was actually the residence of one of the Dogi that ruled the city. It is a stunning palace made of white carved marble that goes up to 4 floors of Baroque style. This beautiful hotel dominates the charming campo Santa Maria Formosa, one of the biggest Campi (squares) of Venice, equally distant both from San Mark's Square and Rialto Bridge, the biggest tourist sites of the city. The closest boat stops are San Zaccaria or Rialto. There is also a private pier at the hotel for access by water taxi. The area is full of life with its small local fresh food market and with its cafe bars and restaurants. Some of the best restaurants are actually just nearby. The hotel overlooks also the famous Santa Maria Formosa Church.","amenities":{"roomService":true},"original_metadata":{"name":null,"city":"Venice","state":null,"country":"IT"},"image_details":{"suffix":".jpg","count":1,"prefix":"https://d2ey9sqrvkqdfs.cloudfront.net/tpDq/"},"number_of_images":97,"default_image_index":1,"imgix_url":"https://kaligo-web-expedia.imgix.net","cloudflare_image_url":"https://www.kaligo-staging.xyz/images/new"},{"id":"trA8","imageCount":30,"latitude":45.4163,"longitude":12.3742,"name":"Venezia - Lido Erizzo 15","address":"Via Erizzo 15","address1":"Via Erizzo 15","rating":0,"distance":5194.334795976459,"trustyou":{"id":null,"score":{"overall":null,"kaligo_overall":0,"solo":null,"couple":null,"family":null,"business":null}},"categories":{},"amenities_ratings":[],"description":"Make yourself comfortable in this apartment, featuring a kitchen with a full-sized refrigerator/freezer and a stovetop.
